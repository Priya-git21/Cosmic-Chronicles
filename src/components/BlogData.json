          "It will be orbiting at about 1.5 million km from Earth in a halo orbit around the Lagrange point 1 (L1) between the Earth and the Sun, where it will study the solar atmosphere, solar magnetic storms, and their impact on the environment around the Earth.",
          "It is the first Indian mission dedicated to observe the Sun. Nigar Shaji is the project's director. Aditya-L1 was launched aboard the PSLV C57 at 11:50 IST on 2 September 2023, ten days after the successful landing of ISRO's Moon mission, Chandrayaan-3.",
          "It successfully achieved its intended orbit nearly an hour later, and separated from its fourth stage at 12:57 IST.[14] It was inserted at the L1 point on 6 January 2024, at 4:17 pm IST."

This is the last of such maneuvres, being directly followed by the Trans-Lagrangian 1 Injection, bound to take place on 19 September.",
          "On 19 September 2023, Aditya-L1 performed its last maneuvre around Earth to escape its orbit and headed towards the Lagrange 1 point. It will take at least four months to further reach its destination, 1.5 million kilometers away.On 30 September 2023, Aditya-L1 had escaped the Earth's sphere of influence and was on the way to the Lagrange point 1.",
          "On 6 October 2023, Aditya-L1 performed a Trajectory Correction maneuvre (TCM1). It was needed to correct the trajectory evaluated after tracking the Trans-Lagrangian Point 1 Insertion (TL1I) maneuvre performed on 19 September 2023.",
